1. Setup the basic robot with the STM32 ROS-Controller, Jetson nano, battery pack with voltage regulator, and Lidar.

2. Setup the STM32CubeIDE on your PC (Linux/Windows/Mac) and validate the working of the ROS-Controller for the motors, encoders, IMU, etc. A demo was shown in the class. 

3. Setup the Jenson nano with the SD-card image.

3. If you already have an SD card image of the Jetson nano with ROS installed you can also use it. If you have a bare Jetson Nano Linux, install ROS melodic following the tutorials here - http://t.ly/WbTvCLinks to an external site. 

4. Calibrate the robot by completing the "09. Robot control course" 
5. Test your Lidar and Mapping by completing the "11. Lidar course - Lidar basic-SLAM"
